1. Click **View Circuit Diagram** to see how the 8051 and DAC are connected in logic diagram and in block diagram.<br />

2. Click **View Assembly Code** to analyse the assembly code used for this experiment.<br />

3. Now according to your analysis write your code in the **Assembly Code Editor**.<br />

4. Click **Check Code** to verify your program against the given code.<br />
<ul>
  <li>If correct → a success message will appear and <b>Start Simulation</b> will be enabled.</li>
  <li>If incorrect → you’ll be asked to review and correct your program.</li>
</ul>
<br />

5. (Optional) You can directly copy code into editor by clicking on **Use Code** in View Assembly code popup.<br />

6. After validation, click **Start Simulation** to run the simulation.<br />

7. Observe the Ramp waveform. You can click at any point to view the values.<br />

8. If you want to save the generated waveform, click **Download Graph**. It will be stored as `dac_ramp_waveform.png`.<br />

9. If you want to save your program, click **Download Assembly Code**. It will be stored as `dac_code.asm`.<br />

10. Click **Reset** to stop the simulation, clear the editor, and reset everything to default.<br />
